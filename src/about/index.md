# SLOMOCO

## 2021 movement and computing durational event

SloMoCo 2021, a durational event-experiment sponsored by the MOCO (Movement and Computing) steering committee and community. SloMoCo is refiguring the conference form via global collaborations in collective knowledge-production, cybernetically informed learning-making structurations, and telematically mediated field practice. SloMoCo temporally (explodes, augments, prolates) the event conference as a site of knowledge production.

## About This Site

This site was created after SloMoCo's conclusion to combine two web presences:

1.  A public facing website hosted on MOCO's servers
2.  A [Manifold instance](https://manifoldapp.org/) where presenters could create their own project pages.

This website is a final archived combination of the two.
