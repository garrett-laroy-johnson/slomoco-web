What is touch in the context of a year of selective, high stakes touching? What shifts when we read the body in kin, or the touch-body, through the lens of matter and making?

TOUCH EXPERIMENTS is a micro-residency exploring the sense and act of touch. It is an experience that happens for, with, and in the body.

The TOUCH EXPERIMENTS micro-residency concludes with a workshop expanding how touch may become part of a/synchronous screen-mediated community.
