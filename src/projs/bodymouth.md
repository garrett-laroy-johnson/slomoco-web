The Sirens is a movement and sound work that turns the body into an instrument for speech. Phoneme by phoneme, dancers sound out full words by performing specific gestures in sequence - these “motion monologues” serve as alternate mythologies, rewriting and rewiring age-old myths of the feminine for our contemporary anxieties.
