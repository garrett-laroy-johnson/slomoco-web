  "description": "The Mapping Porous Borders Project presents a digital exhibition created collaboratively with artists from every continent of the world. Alys Longley has collaborated with Kate Stevenson of DotDot digital design studios and over 60 participating artists to create a bespoke digital platform for visual art exhibition and performance showings that offers a space for sociality, playfulness, choreographic spatiality and interactivity. Through a simple URL, visitors from anywhere in the world can enter this work and discover a labyrinth of maps and landscapes to move through interactively. On the 30 November we will be sharing 14 hours of scheduled live stream experiments, shared in a miniature theatre housed in this digital world, in collaboration with our SloMoCo art residency.",
