"They Told Stories" is an immersive original narrative experience developed using TouchDesigner, Arduino, Max/MSP and various other media tools. The piece focuses on utilizing real time media creation and responsivity to envelope the audience in a fully developed visual and audio story-space. This piece was created from my interest of infiltrating the space of technology in enchanting environments, specifically with the catalyst of storytelling.

They Told Stories original narrative aims to encompass the central concept of lost and evolving beauty. From the natural environments that have and are currently being stripped around us, to the fictional worlds of Tillie Walden’s On a Sunbeam (showcases a crew of explorers who’s entire job is restoring decaying ancient relics/places), Hideo Kojima’s Death Stranding (story centered around the interconnectedness of humanity even in a post-apocalyptic world), and Hayao Miyazaki’s Nausicaa and Princess Mononoke (a direct critique of humanities pervasive incursion of the natural world). Additionally, the concept of data sculptures as seen in the work of Refik Anadol and the projection work of Sila Sveta are particularly inspirational to this piece.
