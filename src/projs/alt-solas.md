[ALT]SOLAS is a proof of concept for a National Science Foundation funded effort into developing a "future for workplace wellness". While the grant was initially focused on the development of furniture, our team took it upon ourselves to develop media enriched environments catalyzed by our creative aspirations and inclinations. We continue exploring how design, media, and environment work collaboratively to engender social and behavioral well-being.
