This roundtable conversation with Roopa Vasudevan, Kate Sicchio, Jie Qi, Christy Bolingbroke, Katya Rozanova, and Greg Corness chaired by Megan Young considers how advances in human-computer interaction are being supported in multidisciplinary collaboratives within and beyond institutional spaces. We consider how the scarcity frameworks are influencing outcomes and how an abundance framework better supports project success. We gather in the spirit of mutual aid, fostering emergent strategies.
