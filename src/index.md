# SLOMOCO

## 2021 movement and computing durational event

SloMoCo 2021, a durational event-experiment sponsored by the MOCO (Movement and Computing) steering committee and community. SloMoCo is refiguring the conference form via global collaborations in collective knowledge-production, cybernetically informed learning-making structurations, and telematically mediated field practice. SloMoCo temporally (explodes, augments, prolates) the event conference as a site of knowledge production.
