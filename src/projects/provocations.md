The Provocations Track @ SloMoCo is part of the ongoing [Provocations Project](https://provocations.online/), launched in 2018 at the Conference on Movement and Computing (MOCO), and sustained via open calls for provocations, online discourse, and public events both within and beyond the MOCO community. The Provocations Project aims to hold space for generative exchange around novel and systemic conditions that affect cross-disciplinary and collaborative practices. The project is not specific to any one discipline, topic, or community, and yet each question posed as part of the project becomes situated through its resonance in a particular context – in this case MOCO and SloMoCo.

## Provocations Track @SloMoCo 2021

Presently, in the context of SloMoCo, we envision a sustained and distributed approach to provocation, revisiting and iterating on past contributions, and inviting new voices into the mix! The Provocations Track @ SloMoCo 2021 involves three phases, spanning the Spring, Summer, and Fall, each addressing a unique question:

### COMPLETE - PHASE 1 | Spring 2021: What escapes computation in interactive performance?

### COMPLETE - PHASE 2 | Summer 2021: What aspects of your practice/research are invisible to your collaborators?

### IN PROGRESS - PHASE 3 | Fall 2021: Devise & Disperse: A 2-Part gathering to develop future iterations of the Provocations Project

---

# PHASE 3 - Devise & Disperse

## A 2-Part gathering to develop future iterations of the Provocations Project

For the third and final phase of SloMoCo 2021, the Provocations Project is looking to expand conceptually and geographically, to develop new questions, to pose them to new communities, and to distribute and decentralize this work by launching a Call for Calls for Provocations. Over the course of two sessions, we will share our approach to developing questions and provocations as a means to probe discourses within and between differentiated communities of practice. Participants of this two-part workshop will be invited to interrogate and remix the provocations process in relation to the prospective communities they wish to engage and provoke, and then, to submit a proposal to host a future call for provocations as part of the Provocations Project.

## [Open Call for Calls for Provocations](https://www.provocations.online/call-for-calls/)

As part of the final phase of the Provocations Track at SloMoCo, we invite attendees to join us for two sessions of structured sharing and devising of questions, as the basis for your own future calls for provocations. The methods and resources that we share as part of this process of decentralization and multiplication of the project are intended to be generous and generative, and will inevitably shift and transform as we enter into collaboration with each of you. There are no a priori restrictions on the topic, timeline, or context of future calls for provocations, so you can think about how your own iteration of the Provocations Project might develop in the coming months or years. These events are open to everyone, and you do not need to prepare anything in advance or commit to future involvement.
