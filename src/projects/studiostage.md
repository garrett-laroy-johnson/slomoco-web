This micro residency will explore the possibilities of a new live coding mini language (JSolang) called Studio//Stage. Studio//Stage is used to live code video on the web in the live coding networked environment Estuary (https://estuary.mcmaster.ca/). The aim is to use dance specific language to create a programming language for the creation of composition that resembles screen dance (dancecinecer0sidexside.mov).
