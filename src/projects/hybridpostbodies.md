    title: "Hybrid Postbodies: Corporeal spatial experiences in virtual reality environments"
---

This article provides an overview of the on-going empirical research titled Hybrid Postbodies that examines
questions concerning the body-space relationship through the lenses of virtual reality environments. The
spatial experiences in virtual reality environments are reviewed under corporeal-body conditions,
experimenting with patterns -material, anatomical, biochemical or digital- for an improved, multisensorial and
dynamic experience context.
