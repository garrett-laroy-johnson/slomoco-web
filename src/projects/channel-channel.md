channel.channel will be an ongoing project and site that will offer interdisciplinary lectures and movement practices. Creating virtual pedagogical spaces that go beyond flat video transmissions and crafting spaces that are rhizomatic and iterative is a core part of our experiment. Using our backgrounds in experimental movement, sound, performance and artificial intelligence, we explore myth, machine, and cellular level communication happening between participants in ecologies. Performance/Video is a way to test out speculative futures and alternative archives-new relational ethics, multiplicity of meaning, and relations to ecologies.
