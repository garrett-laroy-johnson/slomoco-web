    description: I began my creative research by starting an artist’s journal, in addition to my private journaling practice. This journal helped keep track of resources, references, and thoughts. About once a month I created a collage (which is the part of the journal I have chosen to share) to reflect on my research and my recent experience of time. Collectively, they illuminate the larger narrative of my research and help place it in the context of the time when it was created. How can time function not only as part of the content or subject matter but also as a medium through which I explore and understand life?

  - title: "July 2020: Time and Space"
    type: series
    description: This clock focuses on the relationship between Time and Space. Exploring concepts of Einstein’s famous theory of spacetime, known technically as tensor mathematics, I used PoseNet, a pose estimation software using TensorFlow.js, for my autoethnographic research on how our experience of time changes when moving within or beyond boundary boxes. This felt particularly apt during a time when many of us were mostly homebound. If the relative nature of space and time is due to the entanglement of their perception, how is my perception related to the time and space I inhabit?

- title: "September 2020: Time Perspective"
  description: This clock explores how one’s sense of time changes based on perspective. The layering is to demonstrate how changes in perspective can either be an individual’s perspective over time or a result of interacting with other people or forces. I chose the overhead view to illustrate the depth of time or perhaps the perspective of time itself. As Byung-Chul Han states in “The Scent of Time,” “Time deepens vertically instead of stretching along the horizontal narrative path.” The echoing quality of my dancing body, however, breaks up the temporal and narrative continuity, as events no longer have a clear sequence and the past and future of the dance are all being shown in the present. This is what Byung-Chul Han calls “time without scent” or “non-time,” which he attributes to the growing atomization of life and identity, especially with the rise of technology. These factors complicate people’s ability to maintain or change their temporal perspectives.

“Time Enough” is a creative research project studying our perception and experience of time through dance and technology. The piece is composed of 10 smaller-scale experiments (or “clocks,” if you will) each depicting a different element of the research. The layering and juxtaposition of these “clocks” points to a deeper narrative about time and its fluidity depending on context and perspective.

“Time Enough” presents my yearlong creative research project studying our perception and experience of time through dance and technology. The work is composed of 10 smaller-scale experiments (or “clocks,” if you will) each depicting a different element of my research. The layering and juxtaposition of these “clocks” points to a deeper narrative about time and its fluidity depending on context and perspective.

Each “clock” is comprised of 3 parts: an autoethnographic art piece (shown as images or video), an interactive element, and text. These parts are valued equally, with the hope of conveying the same material or questions through each in such a way that they build upon each other but can also stand on their own. The reason for the three different types of engagement, is to let viewers choose how they wish to interact. The attempt to translate somatic practice to an online space is complicated and different for each body. I believe providing choice for modes of interaction and engagement honors this complexity and is particularly important at a time when choices seem frustratingly limited.

Since there is no “right” way of experiencing this project or time itself, the research presented does not conclude in answers, but in questions. The goal is simply to spend some time considering how you experience time. Perhaps just by taking time here and now, you will change your experience of it. I know my perception of time has definitely changed due to my research.
