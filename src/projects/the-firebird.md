The Firebird is a more-than-human sci-fi myth. Their story is told through a choreographic intervention performed by an assemblage of four artists, relational sculptures, and invisible critters. The sculptures work as mixed reality big toys composed of two motion-driven digital layers: the first is sound-reactive and the second is made of augmented reality graphics.

The project is a collaboration with the interpreter-creators Lua Girino, Viola Leqi He, Chaski No and Sol Cabrini (solychaski) and the wearable designer Wei Kang.
