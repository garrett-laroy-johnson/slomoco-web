“FRAMES”, is a performance research project that studies the novel choreographic possibilities made available by a 2D screen connected to the internet under a live performance context. Through live image processing and web technologies, it aims to investigate new techniques of building conversations through movement playbacks, image collages, as well as the themes and emotions that are best conveyed in this format.

FRAMES, a wander between timeframes and image frames.
