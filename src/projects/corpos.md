  subtitle: exploring sound-movement interactions
  author: João Tragtenberg and Thembi Rosa
  type: microresidency
  phase: fall and winter
  description:
    In this micro residency we will develop a methodology to explore movement
    to sound mapping possibilities mediated by Giromin, a IMU based wearable Digital
    Dance and Music Instrument. The methodology will be inspired by Somaesthetic Design
    framework through an iterative process. The experimentation will be both for artistic
    and somatic education contexts. Each encounter will run a full cycle of the methodology,
    either starting from body movement towards sounds inspired by them and the inverted
    process starting from sound. The processes starting from body movement will be
    guided by somatic education practices of Gyrokinesis and a practice with Bamboos
    created by one of the residents (Thembi Rosa), all processes will lead to new
    mapping possibilities from movement qualities and sound parameters. Our goal is
    to explore how we can create new interactive relationships between movement and
    sound and how each mapping strategy changes the way we move, how we perceive our
    bodies and make/hear sounds.
