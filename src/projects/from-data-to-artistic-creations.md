This workshop aims at the practical solutions to the requirements about the use of biometric data in art projects focusing on undergoing research. Together, participants will explore data as a mediation for creation and inspiration. This activity is particularly useful for the organisation of data for artistic creations, in particular music composition, audio reactive visuals and digital art installations.

## Part 1 - Spring 2021

You will share your insights in creating such works of arts and/or musical compositions on the use of physiological data (heart rate, breathing, galvanic reaction) for creating audiovisual artworks. What is the role of bodily reactions in creating and inspiring sound and visual artists? We would like to set the stage for creative practitioners to discuss their needs, desires, and what inspires during the process for artistic research.

## Part 2 - Fall 2021

Together, participants explore data as a mediation for creation and inspiration. This activity is particularly useful for the organisation of data for artistic creations, in particular music composition, audio reactive visuals and digital art installations. Consider how you organize data in your artistic projects. In part one, we identified some ethical, technological/usability, and interpretation issues. During this second session, we will present the functionalities of our creative toolbox and discuss requirements.

## Workshop Facilitators

The workshop is facilitated by a multidisciplinary team of scientists, researchers and artists representing ATHENA Research Center in Athens, Greece.

Vilelmini Kalabratsidou is a cognitive computing scientist and researcher with a specialization in human movement and bio-signal observation during dance performance. She is also a dance performer. Katerina El-Raheb is an adjunct lecturer in performing & digital arts (University of Peloponnese, Greece), a researcher in human computer interaction and also a dance theater performer and artist. Marina Stergiou is a Unity 3d developer, a researcher and a PhD student in human computer interaction with a special interest in kinesthetic applications. Pandelis Diamantides is a sound, visual artist and a researcher working at the intersection of art, science and technology.

This workshop is held in the framework of the research project "Transition to 8: Bridging social issues, tech and contemporary art", which is part of the Operational Programme Competitiveness, Entrepreneurship and Innovation 2014-2020 (EPAnEK) and is co-financed by Greece, the European Union and MENTOR cultural production and management company.
