    <h1>
      (In)Visible Labor: Understanding Roles and Responsibilities in Dance and
      Computing
    </h1>
    <h2>Abstract</h2>
    <p>
      Since the turn of the 21st century, interest in the cross-pollination of
      computing and dance has broadened across both research domains. Growing
      activity in what this presentation describes as the field of dance and
      computing often defines itself both in relation to and distinct from the
      broader field of dance and technology. In this, designating research as
      within/outside the dance and computing field is not so easy. In some
      respects, the nimble and nebulous nature of what comprises dance and
      computing research serves the field. Its broad reaching affiliations
      accommodate a wide variety of research questions and collaborative
      relationships. However, even as dance and computing research stretches and
      moves across boundaries constructed by their perspective areas of
      practice, some key structures, methods, and communities have begun to etch
      a boundary between of what is(n’t) generally understood as dance and
      computing. These tacit thresholds mostly created through a repetition of
      practice and presentation, influence not only what but who is(n’t) seen as
      doing the work of the field.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this presentation, we will discuss both what is and could be considered
      dance and computing research by looking at the activity of those working
      in and around the field. Our conversation will be informed by a large
      corpus study comprised of 135 papers extracted from the Association of
      Computing Machinery (ACM) Digital Library using the general keyword search
      term “dancer.” Using the corpus analysis as a launching point, we will
      review emergent trends and notable gaps found within the data. This
      analysis will be woven with an in-depth, and slightly humorous exploration
      of contemporary trends in robotics and dance research, including a review
      of recent efforts by Boston Dynamics to make their robots dance. Through
      both a macro analysis of broad trends and an in-depth case study of
      dancing robots, this presentation describes and navigates structures
      rooted in both dance and computing that influence who and what is seen as
      doing the labor of dance and computing research.

    <h2>Presenter Bio</h2>
    <p>
      Jessica Rajko is an interdisciplinary scholar/practitioner who applies
      critical feminist approaches to research at the intersection of
      somatically-informed dance and human-computer interaction design. Her most
      recent research investigates how and why dance-based practices and
      choreographic knowledge are integrated, adopted, and at times appropriated
      within computing research. This research is part of a larger collaborative
      initiative to scope out the needs, practices, and desires of the
      ever-evolving field of dance and computing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jessica is an assistant professor at Wayne State University. She joined
      WSU in 2019 as part of a multidisciplinary university hiring initiative in
      Big Data and analytics. She has presented and performed in various
      collaborative artworks nationally and internationally, including
      Amsterdam’s OT301, Toronto’s Scotiabank Nuit Blanche festival and New York
      City’s Gotham Festival at The Joyce Theatre. She was named one of Phoenix
      New Times’s “100 Creatives of 2016” and has been commissioned by the
      Currents New Media Festival, Breaking Ground Dance Festival, Mesa Arts
      Center, Heard Museum, and Phoenix Art Museum. Jessica has been invited to
      present her research at several transdisciplinary institutional programs
      such as Harvard’s Digital Futures Consortium, UPenn’s Price Lab for
      Digital Humanities, and University of New Mexico’s ART Lab. She is a
      regular instructor at the Digital Humanities Summer Institute at
      University of Victoria, where she teachings a summer intensive on
      movement-based approaches to understanding and designing wearable
      technology.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jessica received her MFA in Dance and Interdisciplinary Digital Media at
      Arizona State University in 2009 and her BA in Dance and Psychology at
      Hope College in 2005.
