        that she was having a different experience from me, as she was seeing my
        webcam and just an outline of her body. While in all the other
        experiences we playtested, we were sharing the same experience, in this
        experience we never saw the same images. It&rsquo;s interesting that we
        shared the same space and were able to interact, but were receiving
        different information. In some way this echoes being in physical space
        with someone because you never see yourself, rather you only see the
        people with whom you are sharing the space. &nbsp;</span

        image at all, as I was not seeing it. It only occurred to me as I was
        reviewing the documentation that I maybe should be self aware as someone
        was viewing my image. This reminds me of Nuntinee&rsquo;s feedback from
        playtesting sketch 1. Nun commented that she felt more free in the
        experience when we turned the video off (I shared this feeling). Do we
        feel more free, or more present, when we do not see our own image?

        own image. We can see our own image when we look into the mirror. This
        act makes me self aware and certainly changes the way I feel about
        myself. For me, the act of self observation creates hyper self
        awareness. Could this be a large part of why Zoom calls are so
        exhausting? We not only have to pay attention to the content of the
        call, but we also have to be hyper self aware?</span

      <span
        >In the Jivamukti yoga method (through which I have my yoga teaching
        certification), we do not use mirrors while we practice. Yoga helps to
        get a person grounded in their body, whereas visual feedback takes a
        person out of their body. Thus the focus is more on becoming very close
        with each part of one&rsquo;s body so they can feel where each part of
        their body (down to every last piece of hair) lies in space. We
        cultivate this awareness through honing our senses and awareness. Yoga
        is a personal practice, guided by a teacher. Conversely, as an
        acrobatics/performance instructor, I regularly suggest that my students
        record videos of themselves practicing. When learning a new acrobatics
        sequence there is often a large disconnect between what I feel I am
        doing, and what I am actually doing with my body (that toe never is as
        pointed as I think it is). The visual feedback from videos helps to
        train this awareness. I will continue to consider self awareness as I
        build additional experiences in this series.
